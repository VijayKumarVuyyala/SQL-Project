# Learning journey
This project marks the beginning of my SQL learning journey. It allowed me to learn & apply SQL concepts to real-world data analysis and gain practical experience.
Here are some of the highlights of what l learned and practiced during this fantastic journey:
-> INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, and CROSS JOIN: Gained a solid understanding of different types of joins and how to effectively combine data from multiple tables.
-> Subqueries and Correlated Subqueries:
Explored the power of subqueries, understanding how they can be nested and correlated to handle complex queries efficiently.
-> Common Table Expressions (CTE):
Leveraging CTEs enhanced my query readability and learned to tackle complex problems step by step.
-> User-Defined SQL Functions: I now have the skills to create custom functions to streamline repetitive tasks and improve overall code efficiency.
-> Stored Procedures: Understanding the concept of stored procedures allowed me to modularize code and enhance database performance.
-> Database Views: Grasped the significance of database views in simplifying complex queries and providing a structured interface to access data.
# Window Functions: Learned how to use the
powerful OVER clause, along with functions like ROW_NUMBER, RANK, and DENSE_RANK, to analyze data more effectively.
-> Temporary Tables: Explored the use of temporary tables and their benefits in handling intermediate results during complex data operations.
